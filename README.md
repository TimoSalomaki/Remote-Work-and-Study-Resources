The COVID-19 situation forces people all over the world to work or study remotely for the first time in their lives. This repository aims to aggregate all the important information, free resources and other stuff that helps people make the best of the unfortunate situation and continue with their daily tasks.

> **Note on Tools and Services:** This list deals exclusively with free products/services and premium services that offer free plans for schools, companies and individuals affected by the pandemic. Unfortunately, some companies are trying to benefit from the situation by pretending their pre-existing free trials are actually free handouts, in which case they'll be excluded from the list.

## Contributing

There are certainly many great tools and services that I'm missing from this list. If you know of any, please [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) and I'll review it. There are no specific styling instructions yet but try to adhere to the overall look and feel already present in the document. Keep the following things in mind when contributing:

 > Note for non-technical users: If you're not familiar with GitHub, or have no clue what a "pull request" is and you would like to contribute to this page, feel free to send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hankidesign/). I'll add your suggestions if they're suitable for this page.

- If there's a separate announcement on an official blog etc. with more information about the offering, please link that in the Source column of the table.
- Don't add services that pretend that their pre-existing 30-day trial is suddenly a free COVID-19 exclusive offer.
- Keep the table entries in alphabetical order.
- Sites with excessive ads, paywalls or other limitations will not be accepted. Any articles listed in this repository should be of high quality and be original.
- If you want to provide a translation to your language, feel free to do so. All translations should go to a new file with a two letter language code (ISO 639‑1) suffix. (.e.g -fi, -se etc.)

### What is Needed?

- More free tools with proper categories for both distance learning and remote work
- More hiqh quality articles for students to ease in the transition to distance learning
- Translations into other languages. I will provide the Finnish translation soon but other languages are up for grabs.
